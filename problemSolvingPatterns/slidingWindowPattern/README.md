### Sliding Window Pattern

**Intro:** This pattern involves creating a **window** which can either be an array or number from one position to another

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

**Task:** Write a function called maxSubArraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called **n**. The function should calculate the maximum sum of **n** consecutive elements in the array.


```js
maxSubarraySum([1,2,5,2,8,1,5],2) // 10
maxSubarraySum([1,2,5,2,8,1,5],4) // 17
maxSubarraySum([4,2,1,6],1) // 6
maxSubarraySum([4,2,1,6,2],4) // 13
maxSubarraySum([],4) // null
```
