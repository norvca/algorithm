## Intro
- Starting with first element
  - Comparing it to the next element
    - If it's bigger than the next, swap them
      - move to the next element, keep comparing till the last element
    - If not, do nothing  
      - move to the next element, keep comparing till the last element
- Repeat step 1 till all the elements are sorted

## Complexity
O(nÂ²)
